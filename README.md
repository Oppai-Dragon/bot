# Bot using Long-Polling

This is a simple echo bot - it sends back what it received. He works in a telegram and in VK.

## Getting Started

A little digression. This bot is made very simple, so you will probably find bugs in its work.

### Step 1 - config changes

After unpacking the repository, in the folder with the files, change the name of the file OurConfig.json to MyConfig.json. Now open it.

```json
{ "bot":"telegram"
, "bots":
    [ "vk"
    , "telegram"
    ]
, "vk":
    { "start_request":
        { "path":"https://api.vk.com/method/groups.getLongPollServer"
        , "params":
            [ "group_id"
            , "access_token"
            , "v"
            ]
        , "got":"response"
        }
    , "ask_request":
        { "path":"<server>"
        , "params":
            [ "act"
            , "key"
            , "wait"
            , "mode"
            , "ts"
            ]
        , "got":"updates"
        }
    , "send_request":
        { "path":"https://api.vk.com/method/messages.send"
        , "params":
            [ "user_id"
            , "random_id"
            , "peer_id"
            , "message"
            , "attachment"
            , "access_token"
            , "v"
            ]
        }
    , "act":"a_check"
    , "wait":25
    , "mode":2
    , "msgField":"message"
    , "access_token":""
    , "keyboard":

        }
    , "peer_id":0
    , "group_id":0
    , "v":"5.103"
    }
, "telegram":
    { "start_request":
        { "path":"https://api.telegram.org/bot<access_token>/getUpdates"
        , "params":
            [ "timeout"
            ]
        , "got":"result"
        }
    , "ask_request":

        , "params":
            [ "chat_id"
            , "text"
            ]
        }
    , "timeout":30
    , "access_token":""
    , "keyboard":
        { "reply_markup":"{\"keyboard\":[[{\"text\":\"1\"},{\"text\":\"2\"},{\"text\":\"3\"},{\"text\":\"4\"},{\"text\":\"5\"}]],\"resize_keyboard\":true,\"one_time_keyboard\":true}"
        }
    , "isSendMsg":true
    , "msgField":"text"
    }
, "repeatN":1

, "helpMsg":"Hey. I am a simple echo-bot - I write back what they wrote to me. If you want to change how many times I reply to one of your messages, then write /repeat "
, "logLevel":"DEBUG"
}
```
#### VK Bot
To work VK bot you must have 3 fields correctly filled in: accessT, peerId, societyId.
1. accessT: this is the access token.
   - [This is the documentation for receiving it.](https://vk.com/dev/bots_docs?f=1.1.%20%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B0%20%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%B0)
   - However, the easiest way to get it is through the community. To do this, of course, you need to be registered.
     - Then click on "Communities".
     - "Create community"
     - "Manage"
     - "API usage" and "Create token"
     - Now you need to choose what you can do using this token. Select 1 and 2: "Allow the application to control the community" and "Allow access to community messages", so that the bot can send messages to users. Creating a token is very important, as it can be used for hacking. Therefore, you have to confirm its creation, for example, using push notification on the phone.
     - Copy it and paste between double quotes in MyConfig.json, as the value of the accessT field. Remember to activate the LongPoll API and synchronize the version of the API with the "v" field in MyConfig.json. For everything to work correctly, put "API version: 5.103". Since it was everything that was created on it.
     - It is also very important which events are activated - the server will respond to your json request with event information. Since this is an echo bot, activate only "Message received".

2. peerId: this is an equally important parameter, the identifier of the conversation.
   - Bots need community permission to send messages. And his conversation.
   - Then create a chat. And enter it by clicking on the icon.
   - After they entered the chat, a number appeared in the address bar. We only need a number. In my example, this is the number 101. It needs to be entered between double quotes as the value of the peerId field.

3. societyId: This is the easiest, go to your community and there will be a number in the address bar.

#### Telegram Bot
For the telegram bot to work, you must fill out accessT, nameBot.
The telegram documentation describes well how to get the values you need, so [here](https://tlgrm.ru/docs/bots).
If you have problems with the documentation, then just write this bot in a telegram - [@BotFather](https://tele.gs/botfather) .

#### Details of MyConfig.json
Next I will explain the meaning of the remaining fields, so if you are not interested in this, proceed to the second step.

1. keyb: the value is json as a string. This is the keyboard that becomes visible if you write the /repeat command to the bot.
2. nameBot: the name of the bot that you give in correspondence with the [@BotFather](https://tele.gs/botfather).
3. proxyHost, proxyPort: requests for bot telegrams are sent through a proxy. If the entered proxy has stopped working, change it by finding a new one [here](http://spys.one/en/https-ssl-proxy/). You need an HTTP proxy.
4. updateId, chatId, isSendMessage: the first two parameters are obtained during the operation of the bot, and the last parameter should NOT be touched.
5. repeatN: the value is the initial number of bot retries per message.
6. v: the version of the API used by the server. Methods change with versions over time, so itâ€™s better not to touch this value.
7. lastMsg, repeatMsg, helpMsg, testMsg: all fields that end in -Msg serve only to simplify so as not to clog the code.
   - lastMsg: this is just the last message sent.
   - repeatMsg: This is a message that is sent in response to the /repeat command.
   - helpMsg: This is a message that is sent in response to the /help command.
   - testMsg: This is the message that the user receives in case of failure of the language test. Due to a certain design of queries, not all characters are successfully packed and unpacked, so the user may receive an indistinct answer. The language test checks which language the message is written in, you can only write in Russian, the symbol No. is also Russian. Or only in English, using any other characters.
8. logLevel: During the execution of the program, on the passage of key and not only moments, logs will be sent to the console. Only 4 levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
   - DEBUG is the most insignificant.
   - INFO - reports on key points.
   - WARNING - warns of possible errors.
   - ERROR - indicates a critical error, which prevents further execution.
DEBUG < INFO < WARNING < ERROR. Thus, by entering a certain level of logging into the value of the "logLevel" field, the application will send logs whose level is either equal to or higher than the specified level.

### Step 2 - building and testing
In the root folder of the repository, open git bash and write the following commands.
```git
$ stack build
```
And after successfully assembling. This way you will do a little check.
```git
$ stack test
```
If problems arise at this or subsequent stages. I left my contacts at the very end.

### Step 3 - explanation of work
The logic of the beginning of correspondence is this: since the bot writes to the user on behalf of the community, the user must allow this community to send messages to him. After the user writes a message to the general community conversation that you created in the first step, the bot will send you an answer to the new correspondence that he created for you. Now you can chat with him using the new correspondence. To change the bot that you want to run, just change its name in MyConfig.json.
![HelpWithNotification](images/helpWithNotification.png)

You can start the application from git bash with this line.
```git
$ stack exec bot-exe
```
To stop an application launched in this way, first select the git bash window as the active one and press crtl + c.
If you closed git bash before the application stopped, then it will continue to work until you shut it down, for example, through the task manager.
Also after the assembly botvk2-exe.exe appeared, it is located in botvk2\.stack-work\install\a752600e\bin.
